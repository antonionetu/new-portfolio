						I started my career in 2018 when I was invited to a course at UFS
						(Federal University of Sergipe), where I began to engage in external
						projects and gained knowledge in various programming languages and
						market technologies. Throughout this journey, I participated in
						several projects proposed by UFS, educational companies, COD3R,
						Fundação Bradesco, Curso em Video, and Udemy courses.
					</p>
					<p style={{ marginBottom: "1vw" }}>
						After UFS, I worked as a freelancer for 1 year, developing websites,
						apps, and systems for various clients and projects. I have been
						working at a startup for almost 2 years, where I developed skills in
						different technologies and participated in innovative projects.
						During this time, I also worked on two 6-month parallel projects.
						Additionally, I was part of a team that developed a product for a
						large bank in Brazil, collaborating in the creation of
						high-complexity technological solutions.

						Currently, I am a university student in Computer Science at UNIT and
						am also pursuing Computer Systems at Riga Technical University
						(RTU).
